## Overview

This is a random dice rolling app.

Users should be able to:

- Click the button to roll the dice
- The dice should animate (shake), then change.
- The total of the roll should be displayed and a character revealed according to the number rolled

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- javascript

### What I learned

I was excited to be able to add the dice animation and the conditional statement for the character reveal while creating the html element to this project.  These were stretches for me and I accomplished them on my own.  Every accomplishment is a step towards being a better coder!
